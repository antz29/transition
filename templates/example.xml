		A project has a number of deployement tasks that are executed in order.

		targets. When the a deployment is started a target is specified and tasks
		that do not include the specified target are skipped.
	-->

	<!-- 
		Firstly export the project from the svn repository, if the 'abs' parameter 
		is not set, then /tags/{RELEASE} will be appended to the supplied source.
		When 'abs' is set, the source is passed to svn unchanged. This would
		normally be used to include external libraries.

		If required you can perform any number of string replacements before you

		Generally, after processing the exported code you will rsync it to prdnfs054
		where it is queued for deployment to either the pre or prod environments. You
		have to specify a source and a target, ensuring that both include a final '/'.
		Both are standard rsync paths.

			push this project to pre use:

			deploy_dev@prdnfs054:/home/deploy_dev/php/{PROJECT}/

			for prod:

			deploy_ops@prdnfs054:/home/deploy_ops/php/{PROJECT}/

		The replicate tasks are only executed on prdnfs054 and specify where the 
		files are to be deployed. This effectively a standard rsync task, but with the
		exception that after the last replicate task is completed, the source files
		are deleted; in this case '/home/deploy_dev/php/{PROJECT}/'.

		You will need to create a separate replicate task for each of the desired
		final endpoints for your project in both pre and prod environments, this
		could include for example each of the live webservers.
